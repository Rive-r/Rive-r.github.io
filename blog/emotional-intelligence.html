      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is a set of sckills related to understanding
        yourself, and the people around you. And the ability to integrate this
        information into your thinking and actions.
      </p>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        IQ is a measure of ones ability to problem solve, use critical thinking
        and perform arithmetic tasks. It is derived from a set of standardised
        tests meant to rank a persons age against a standardised performance one
        might be expected to have at a certain age. Emotional intelligence is
        different in that it relates to how well you can empathise and
        understand what is happening within yourself and in those around you.
        This can vary greatly based on ones experience and outlook.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is important for many reasons. Developing your EQ
        can lead to increased cognitive skills, a greater sense of calm or
        peace, and importantly how you interact and integrate with those around
        you. As humans are social creatures the benefits of gaining an increased
        understanding for yourself and those around you cannot be understated.
        It is also said that in the workplace having a good EQ is perhaps more
        important to career development than iq.
