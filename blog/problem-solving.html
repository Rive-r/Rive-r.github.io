      <h2>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        During the initial CSS and HTML blog set up I was having a really tough time figuring out how to get my navigation buttons centred in the middle of the page.
        It seemed like such a simple problem to overcome but every thing that I would try would leave one small aspect of it not quite how I wanted.
        It had to do with nesting types and how the flex property works, which I didn't understand well then and only do a bit more so now. I called my friend to help, though HTML and CSS aren't his strong suits either. He did offer me the advice of playing with the different options directly in the browser though.
        This combined with a bit of googling and good old try on the fly, eventually got those buttons and their text comfortably centred. Whew, first of many steps on the path to competence!

      <h2>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        During the Javascript Kata exercises on Replit I was feeling comfortable and relatively more at home with the content so I was able to take the time to do the stretch exercises.
        Even though I was getting through at quite a pace it would be hubris to think there werent things I could be doing better. In the Super Fizzbuzz exercise I noticed quite quickly that I could re-use the code that I had just written for the fizzbuzz portion. 
        Upon a returning look during a refactoring pass, I realised I could go just a little further. My implementation had been with a classic for loop with calls to the previous function while adding to a new array. What I realised was that I could implement a new function that I had not yet used. 
        By using the array map function I was able to condense around four lines of code into just two. Then, just when I thought I had done all I could, I realised I could remove one redundant declaration and turn it into one elegant return statement with inline function call.
        Im still not sure that it is peak efficiency from a character count perspective, but I doubt there is any difference at runtime. Just goes to show there is always room for improvement!
