    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway</h2>
    <p>Mostly I want to be a competent devloper able to work confidently in the field. I hope to use the skills I learn
      during the course as a jumping off point to become a working developer that's able to contribute positively to a
      team that's ideally doing something that effects positive change on the world, i.e. not just capitalism.</p>
    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp</h2>
    <p>I will definitely have some strength coming from my previous experience with programming, I will need to be
      mindful that this does not become a weakness as it will still be necessary for me to put in time to practise and
      learn new skills. I hope that I wlil be able to put my best foot forward and be a good communicator as I described
      in my foundations learning plan. My idea of these has more or less stayed the same, though I have become more
      aware of how introverted I have become.</p>
    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be></h2>
    <p>Definitely time management and focus. These have always been points of weakness for me although I tend to do
      better when around others. These are also the skills that I want to see developed in myself at Dev Academy.
      Self-directed learning and better time management would help me immensely.</p>
    <h2>What are your expectations from the bootcamp team></h2>
    <p>To be supportive and available for help in my learning.</p>
    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>I expect myself to be professional and cordial. To compose myself in a manner that is conducive to effective
      learning from myself and those around me. I commit to manage my time responsibly while at bootcamp and also in the
      time between bootcamp sessions. To be open minded and maintain a positive, growth mindset.

    <h2>Foundations learning plan</h2>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    My long term goal is to become self-sufficient and employable with the ability to travel and follow my own interests
    outside of work.
    I have previously been in the tech industry but wanted to move into being a devleloper and was not getting the right
    opportunities to learn.
    I hope to be able to move on from devacademy with the skills necessary to be a full-stack web developer capable of
    getting contract work and defining my own hours.

    <h2>A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
    My biggest strength is working in a team. I am a good communicator and enjoy helping others work together as well.
    My biggest limitation is being able to focus and complete work when I am on my own.
    <h2>What core skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy</h2>
    My biggest goal is to improve at learning when I am by myself, self directed learning.
    <h2>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators
      and industry/community representatives</h2>
    I'll try and stick to the time boxes and use the time tracker. I will keep an open mind and gentle ear to the people
    around me.
    <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
    I will try and break things down into their component parts and work through them piece by piece. If I am getting
    overwhelmed I will reach out to a facilitator and let them know what is going on.
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    I will begin by posting in the tech questions discord group to see if my peers can help me.
    If I cannot work through my problem here I will post in the help requests channel and wait for a facilitator to
    help.
    I will commit to working through the problem with the facilitator.
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    I expect the facilitators to help when I am stuck and set me on the right track while also allowing me to use and
    develop my own learning pathways.
