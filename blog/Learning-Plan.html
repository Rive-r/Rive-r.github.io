        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        My long term goal is to become self-sufficient and employable with the ability to travel and follow my own interests outside of work.
        I have previously been in the tech industry but wanted to move into being a devleloper and was not getting the right opportunities to learn. 
        I hope to be able to move on from devacademy with the skills necessary to be a full-stack web developer capable of getting contract work and defining my own hours.

        <h2>A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        My biggest strength is working in a team. I am a good communicator and enjoy helping others work together as well.
        My biggest limitation is being able to focus and complete work when I am on my own.
        <h2>What core skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy</h2>
        My biggest goal is to improve at learning when I am by myself, self directed learning.
        <h2>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>
        I'll try and stick to the time boxes and use the time tracker. I will keep an open mind and gentle ear to the people around me. 
        <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
        I will try and break things down into their component parts and work through them piece by piece. If I am getting overwhelmed I will reach out to a facilitator and let them know what is going on.
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        I will begin by posting in the tech questions discord group to see if my peers can help me.
        If I cannot work through my problem here I will post in the help requests channel and wait for a facilitator to help.
        I will commit to working through the problem with the facilitator.
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        I expect the facilitators to help when I am stuck and set me on the right track while also allowing me to use and develop my own learning pathways.
