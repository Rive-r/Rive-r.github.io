        <h2>A situation where I have had an ethical decision
          to make. </h2>There was a moment when I was out shopping at Chaffers New
        World and the was a person being held by a number of employees that was
        clearly in distress and screaming that the employee had hit her and
        pleading that they be let go. There did not seem to be anyone offering
        help to this person. I had to weigh up the values of empathy, fairness
        and social responsibility. I decided to call out to the employees and
        tell them to let her go and get off of her. The employees responded
        telling me that this person had tried to steal a bunch of meat. I
        responded with my disdain for capitalism and reiterated my request that
        they release this person. As I completed my shopping I came around to
        where this was still happening and the person being held was crying, and
        the police were just arriving in the store. I quickly got this person's
        attention and told them to remember the person that had assaulted her
        and to press charges against this individual when detained by the
        police. The consequences of this action was that the person was able to
        calm down a bit and seemed comforted that there was somebody that cared
        about their suffering. Hopefully this also gave them leverage to any
        charges laid against them. The other consequence was that I was forcibly
        removed from the store and was also verbally trespassed from entering
        the store again.
        <h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity.</h2>
        My Father is a New Zealand pakeha, my mother is Maltese. I was raised in
        Poneke, Wellington. My mother was raised with very little and as such
        has a culture that has very much raised me to be frugal and resourceful,
        with a great regard for the value of things and an aversion to waste.
        Furthermore family and community has always been an important part of my
        upbringing and remain important to me now. 
        <h2>My strengths and limitations</h2>
        in terms of learning and career development, and their intersection with
        learning obstacles. I think one of my great strengths is in working as a
        team. I very much feed off of group energy and love to help others work
        together. As well as the feeling of encouragement that I get from
        contributing to a team. This I think will help me in my learning journey
        at DevAcademy in particular. This also intersects with a learning
        obstacle in that I find it hard to focus on my own work when I don’t
        have external forces keeping me focused.
        
        <h2>An experience working with
          others where there was resistance or tension.</h2> 
        When I was working at
        Kiwibank as a software tester intern I had a group project with another
        intern. The intern that I was working with had completed her full
        Computer-Science degree while I had only done one year of mine before
        withdrawing. This project was analysis based and required research and
        the writing of a process framework for presentation. I found that my
        coworker was somewhat dismissive of my ideas and was very much trying to
        take the lead and somewhat do the project herself. I tried my best to
        facilitate our working together and work on our different parts then
        integrate them into the document together. This was somewhat successful
        but I could still feel that she didn’t really respect my contributions.
        I just tried my best to maintain a calm and productive environment. In
        the end she began to value my contributions and we delivered a project
        that we were both happy with. At some point following this she actually
        brought up to me that she was sorry for how she was acting and that she
        held a bit of resentment because she thought she would have seen me more
        at school if I had been there as we were in the same cohort (she was
        under the impression that I had said that I did the whole course). I
        explained to her that I had withdrawn for health reasons and she was
        very understanding and apologetic for her misconception. I think this
        was the best strategy I could have tried at the time. I could maybe try
        to clear up such an issue in the future by trying to ask the person
        directly, but I would make sure to be careful in my wording as I would
        not want to come off confrontational. I think the best strategy going
        forward would be to remain professional but bring up communication
        issues if they are there without being presumptuous or judgemental.
