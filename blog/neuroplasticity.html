      <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain reorganise its structure based on the activities that you use it for.
        Understanding that on a funamental level we are able to physically change the way we think can be a liberating and hopeful feeling for people in all types of situations.
        For example in cognative behavioural therapy for treatment of trauma one learns to identify mental triggers that lead to negative pathways, and consciously reroute the thought before stress and anxiety become overwhelming.
        Knowing that this process can physically change the unconscious mind long-term gives hope and over time can lead to significant increase in quality of life.
      </p>
      <h2></h2>Iscuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h2>
      <p>
        Most examples of neuroplasticity are a lot less directly involved than the previous example. Neuroplacsticity is in action any time you learn or practise anything new.
        One of the biggest factors in strengthening neural pathways is repetition. Use it, improve it. With this in mind I will set regular practise sessions for new skills that I am trying to learn,
        such as coding Javascipt.
      </p>
      <h2>WHhat are some of the ways you can increase you neuroplasticity></h2>
      <p>
        Eating Right. Rewiring your brain is a physical process, so providing yourself with the proper nutrients is paramount.
        Sleeping regularly. Downtime is just as important to help your brain grow and solidify your learning. Some studies suggest that even taking short naps during the day can encourage the growth of dendritic spines, the branches of the neuronal tree.
        Learn a new skill, even something simple like sudoku or juggling. The important part is that you are consciously exercising your decision making ability.
        Mindfulness. The calmness and self awareness of your actions helps your brain make sense of your days tasks.

      <h2>
        Discuss a growth mindset and why it is relevant.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is being of a state of mind that you are capable of change. This is relevant as it's a direct implication of the science of neuroplasticity.
        People often say, to young people in particular that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. It sounds a bit idealistic but it's not far from the truth.
        I would add the caveat that you can do anywthing, provided you have the resources and the motivation. When it comes to skills and abilities, time is the most valuable resource there is. In this scenario, the statement holds true.
        Let's take the idiom that to master a skill means you have put in 10,000 hours practising that thing. Wether or not the math is exact, it's quite hard to imagine that you would be anything less than impressive at something if you put in that much time.
        It follows that if you do it, and keep doing it, you will get better. No matter what.

      <h2>
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was really just reminded and reassured that I still have time to become the developer that i've wanted to be for so long.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I  will remember that as long as I put in the time, i'll be able to achieve what I hope to achieve. When things are confusing or difficult, ill remember that i've already gotten better at it than when I first started the day, and resolve to keep going until I get it.
