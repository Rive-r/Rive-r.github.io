      <h2>Best Practices in using Classes vs Ids</h2>
      <p>
        CSS and HTML are the basic
        building blocks of web pages. In simple terms HTML describes the
        information that is displayed on a webpage, and CSS are the rules used
        to describe the styles in which that information is displayed. While it
        is possible to define rules that would apply to all of the data in a
        page, it is often better to describe different rules for different areas
        of the page. This allows a lot more diversity as you can imagine there
        are usually a number of different elements on a page. There are a few
        different ways we can do this, the two we will be talking about today
        are classes and Ids.

      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <p>
        Classes are used to define a set of rules
        that will be re-used for different elements of the same type. For
        example we might have a class that defines attributes for an article
        section. This can be any type of attribute such as font size, alignment,
        margins etc. The way we define classes is within the css file. First we
        let the computer know we are referencing a class by using the dot
        notation “.” followed by the class name. This is typically done with
        lowercase words separated by hyphens. You follow this name with curly
        brackets “{}” and put the relevant rules within those braces. An example
        of this is shown below. 
      </p>
      <p>  <img src="../images/title_class.JPG" alt="Class CSS">
      </p>
      <p>To call upon a class within the
        html we name the class within the element declaration. We do this by
        calling class=”class-name”. An example of this is shown below. <img src="../images/title_class_html.JPG" alt="Class HTML">
      </p>
      <h2>IDs</h2>
      <p> In contrast to classes, IDs are used when we want to define a
        set of rules that will only be used for one element. For example we
        might use an ID for a navigation bar or footer image etc. The naming
        convention for IDs is the same as for classes with lower case words
        separated by hyphens, but we define them in CSS with a hashtag “#”
        instead of a dot. The same curly braces are used to define the rules.
        Example below.
      </p>
      <p> <img src="../images/ID_CSS.JPG" alt="ID CSS">
        </p>
        <p>We call upon the ID with a similar method in
        the HTML within the element declaration, but instead of
        class=”class-name” it is id=”id-name”. An example is shown below.
        <img src="../images/ID_HTML.JPG" alt="ID HTML">
      </p>
      <p> It is important to remember to use IDs only once, as the
        interpreter is only expecting one and having multiple elements with the
        same ID can cause bugs. Something to remember with IDs is that they are
        given higher priority than classes. This means that if you have an
        element with both a class and an ID, then the ID will overwrite any
        attributes that are shared between the class and the ID. Make sure to
        remember this when using both class and ID on the same element.</p>
