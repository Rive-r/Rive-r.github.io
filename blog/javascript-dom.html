      <h2>Javascript Technical Blog</h2>
      <h2>Javascript, HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        In a recent blog post we talked about how HTML and CSS are the basic
        building blocks of all webpages. While this is true there is another
        element we have not yet discussed - Javascript. While not the only
        language used in web development, it is by far and away the most
        commonly used. In technical terms HTML and CSS are not programming
        languages, they are markup languages. Javascript, however is a
        programming language. Another way to understand this would be, if HTML
        is the information on the page, and CSS is the style in which we display
        that information then Javascript handles any interactions and more
        complex functions the site may have.
      </p>
      <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow in Javascript relates to how the code is run. In essence it
        is the logic of the code. Code is run from top to bottom, unless it hits
        an element that alters the control flow such as conditional statement,
        or loop. You can think of this like a choose your own adventure novel.
        If you were to read the book from cover to cover, it would be a jumble
        of stories with no logic tying together the individual outcomes. Each
        time you make a decision in the novel, think of that as a control flow
        element. Controlling how the story flows from one point to the next,
        based on the decision you make at the junction. Loops are an element
        that run a portion of code for a number of times before meeting certain
        conditions and moving on. To explain this lets think about washing a
        dirty plate. We could break this action down into smaller actions, like
        an individual scrub. Instead of scrubbing just once, or ten times etc.
        We want to scrub until our plate is clean. So we need to know when the
        plate will be clean, and let's say thats when we see no more dirt. So if
        we run the loop once - scrub the plate once - and we see dirt still
        remains. So the loop runs again. This process will repeat until there is
        no dirt remaining, which means we can exit the loop. And we move on to
        the next process, e.g. rinsing the plate.
      </p>
      <h2>Description of the DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM is an acronym that represents Document Object Model. It's
        function is to give us a way to interact with the HTML portion of a
        webpage using Javascript. That is what the document part of the acronym
        means - the HTML document that makes up the backbone of the webpage. The
        object part of it refers to the way in which Javascript handles data.
        Any entity or element described in the HTML document is converted into
        an object or node to be represented in the DOM. The model part of the
        acronym means that it is just a model of the HTML and not the real
        thing. But it does give us the ability to interact and change the real
        document. This is done through various functions that can be called on
        the "document" object in Javascript.
      </p>
      <h2>Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Arrays and Objects are two data types in Javascipt. Technically speaking
        arrays are actually a type of object, but they behave in different ways.
        Both arrays and objects are used for storing many values, but each have
        distinct ways of accessing the data within them. Accessing data in
        arrays is done by index. In a sense, an array is like an ordered list.
        With each item in the list being stored at given position beginning at
        index 0, up to however many objects are stored. This is done in the
        format arrayName[index] , where index is a number. INSERT IMAGE
        Accessing data in objects is done by key. Objects store data in the
        format of key and value pairs. Each key property corresponds to a
        property value that will get returned. This is because you can have
        multiple iterations of an object, each with the same keys/properties,
        but different values. This is done in the format object.keyName, or
        object["keyName"]. INSERT IMAGE
      </p>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are a useful way to define pieces of code that we want to use
        more than once. When put into our code, a function is not run until we
        call it by it's name. Functions are given a name, and defined with or
        without arguments. Followed by curly braces. We put the code that weff
        want to run when we call the function within the curly braces. Functions
        can run their code and do some action, and can also return information.
        function functionName(argument1,argument2){ some code that we want to
        run } It is useful to write functions when we want to do some series of
        computations more than once like say update the score in a game, or
        return a random value between two integers. The following code is a
        function that we can use to give a random value between integers. \
        INSERT IMAGE In this case, the value returned by the function is the
        random integer that has been computed between the provided values. This
        helps because instead of having to write out that code every time we
        want the random integer, we can just call the function. It is also
        adaptive in that we can use it for different input variations.
