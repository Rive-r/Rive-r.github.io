    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I have learned that my ego can get in the way of producing work when I find it hard to relate to the content
      and get stuck trying to use my voice in an area that it feels uncomfortable.
      I have learned the importance of setting goals and being mindful of ones actions in the context of achieving
      those goals. I have learned that neuroplasticity takes focused and concerted effort but through maintaining a
      growth mindsest I can keep moving forward.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>Values are the basis of who you are and how you interact with the world. In programming this informs the way
      that you approach problems but also the way that you interact with those around you.
      Empathy is important to how well you can work alongside others. It can help you to better understand your
      coworkers and produce better results together.
      Self-awareness helps you stay focused and doing the relevant work. It also helps to understand how your own
      values affect the way that you are interacting with others.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>Im surprised at how challenging I found it. Even though I was familiar with the concepts it was hard for me to
      be open and communicate about myself in a way that was true to myself but also fit the requirements.</p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I think the self reflection and analysis was the hardest part for me. It is hard to look at yourself
      objectively and identify where I struggle and need to work on things.
      It was also hard to switch mindset from doing technical work to doing emotional work each week.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
      development Bootcamp course></h2>
    <p>There is a lot to be gained from the core skills developed during the course. Self awareness and empathy are
      very important in the workplace and is not often tought in traditional education. It makes sense to fill that
      gap as it can increase the success of the students that go through the course.</p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
      time to practise programming instead?</h2>
    <p>As much as it frustrated me at times, I think it was definitely valuable and i'm sure will be more important
      and have a bigger role once bootcamp starts in person.</p>
